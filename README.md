# Analysis of all Green Stocks

## Overview of Project
During this analysis we will be helping Steve refactor the previous code we had prepared for him. This new code will loop through all the data in a more efficient manner so that Steve can do a more in depth analysis of all the dataset. We will provide a comparison of the time the original code takes to run vs the new refractored code. Also, comment on the advantages and disadvantages of refractorng code.

## Results

### Stock Performance Comparison (2017 vs 2018)

The initial purpose of this project was to help Steve analyse the dataset that includes all stocks on green companies so that his parents can take an informed decison on where it's best to invest. Taking a look at the resutls from 12 differet companies through the years of 2017 and 2018 the best option for investments would be to divide their investments between ENPH and RUN. Both this companies show growth during both years and in an important amount. Steve's parents can now divide their investments between more than one company and not have all their eggs in one basket. Also, Steve can keep using the code in upcomming years to keep an eye on how every company is doing and make an informed decision every year.
