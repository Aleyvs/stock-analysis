# Analysis of all Green Stocks

## Overview of Project
During this analysis we will be helping Steve refactor the previous code we had prepared for him. This new code will loop through all the data in a more efficient manner so that Steve can do a more in depth analysis of all the dataset. We will provide a comparison of the time the original code takes to run vs the new refractored code. Also, comment on the advantages and disadvantages of refractorng code.
